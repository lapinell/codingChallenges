# codingChallenges
These are weekly coding challenges I've found across the internet

As a UX-UI Designer and Front End Developer, I complete the whole design through development process with each challenge. I've allowed myself up to 8 hours, across 3 days, to complete each challenge as seen below:

**Day 1**
* Set up of repo and readme
* Breakdown of task
* Design of task

**Day 2**
* Testing design
* Starting development

**Day 3**
* Overflow

## Challenges

[**CodeByte's Number Factorial Javascript Challenge**](https://github.com/lapinell/codingChallenges/tree/master/numberFactorial)

This challenge was classified as easy and required the developer to create a method or methods for generating a product from the factorials of a single number.
